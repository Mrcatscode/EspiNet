Thank you for installing EspiNet!

EspiNet is an unblocked application for group and direct communications, without having to worry about the school seeing your messages!.

EspiNet was originally made when the original dev was bored one day, but now
EspiNet has the goal of connecting users with freedom, anonymity and rights.
I hate when schools block the ability to communicate in such an effective way
or try to spy on everything being sent, EspiNet is constantly being updated so that
it is as difficult to read important information as possible!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules:

1. Freedom of speach is a VERY important part of EspiNet but some
people choose to abuse that freedom and so targeted hate speech
is bannable (No hate against: minorities, ethnic groups, Lgbtq+)

2. No bypassing a ban! Users who bypass a ban will be PERMANANTLY banned.
Most bans are temporary and are reset when the server is reset but permanant bans are HARDCODED into the server! newer versions of EspiNet 
will have the user PRE-BANNED and the anti-bypass measures are constantly
being updated, re-worked and improved! --- IP Bans Have Been Added!

3. No impersonating a dev/admin/mod Any impersonators will be banned!
We at EspiNet try very hard to keep everything peaceful, if someone is impersonating one of us then that can damage the EspiNet team's reputation!

4. No spamming! Spammers will be banned as soon as an admin/mod sees the spammer! If you need more space to type then put in a request to change the max type space! But at the moment users are allowed to type 500 unique characters within one message.

5. Rude names are OK! but if they directly target a specific race or group of people then that user will be asked to change their name. if the name is not changed that user will be BANNED.

6. No bullying! All users are allowed to be on EspiNet without the fear of harassment and or bullying!

7. This rule is for the admins! Just because you are an admin does NOT mean you are more privileged than
any other user, you still have to follow all of the previous rules with the exception being in rule 3 for obvious reasons. Admins have a much more direct way of communicating with me (Original Dev) and so they do have a higher chance of being unbanned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EspiNet team currently consists of one developer and 2 aadmin users, this means
I need more admin users that I can trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common rooms:
Rooms are case sensitive which means: Updates is not the same as updates. Make sure uppercase letters are correct!

1. Global <-- This is the default room, you are put into this room automatically and there are 4 ways of reaching this room!

2. Updates <-- This is where devs like to talk about future additions to EspiNet.

3. AdminSpace <-- Only admins can actually reach this room.

4-inf. You can create ANY room code to make your own rooms! <-- This means DIRECT messaging is possible if only 2 people know the room code!

5-inf. Common 'class codes' are formatted as Room+yearlevel <-- so if you are in year 11 english you type >> English11 or if you are in year 12 math you type >> Math12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EspiNet team is constantly growing and needs more people all the time! so if you think you are capable of handling situations and can hold back against excessive banning p̶l̶e̶a̶s̶e̶ ̶p̶u̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶u̶b̶m̶i̶s̶s̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶r̶o̶o̶m̶

get your request seen MUCH faster!)

EspiNet is built as a Python executable.

Thank you again for installing EspiNet!

Bonus stuff:

If you have any requests for EspiNet then feel free to tell an admin or tell me (Original Dev) directly,
I love adding things to EspiNet so I will try my best to make sure there are as many features as possible.
The admins are here to help the community hosted on EspiNet, so feel free to ask them for help or ask them for
other information about EspiNet! (Q&A with admins may vary in validity depending on the admin.)

There are some commands that can be used for EspiNet:
Discord style emoji commands >> :sob:, :smile:, :heart: and more!

/flip >> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
/lenny >> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

and more!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EspiNet has its own bot named Mere!
You can activate Mere by using !mere and then typing what you want to tell Mere (You can add !Mere anywhere in your text, it does not have
to be at the beginning)
NOTE: Please do NOT abuse Mere, Mere learns and grows with EVERY user prompt!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please DO NOT abuse Mere, Mere learns and adapts based off of EVERYONES prompts
every prompt will help Mere learn and adapt (This means if anyone decides
to start trying to teach Mere how to be extremely rude or racist then it affects everyone
and the user who does this WILL BE BANNED) OWNER does have access to what users say
to Mere!!!

FAQ:

Q: "It says that there is a virus" or "My computer says it may be malicious" when trying to open or
download EspiNer

A: Sometimes if the device does not know where an app came from the device will
say it is possibly malicous (Even when it isn't) you may be able to press more details and
"Run anyway" but if that does't work then you may need to disable your anti-virus (Figure out the rest yourself)

Q: How do I know if the room I made works?

A: If all the previous text from the previous room is gone then you are in a new room
if you type some stuff and try to go back to the previous room you will see the text will
dissappear

Q: When I try to open EspiNet a popup appears saying something went wrong?

A: EspiNet is run on the school network through a singular laptop, we don't have
a dedicated server just yet, so sometimes the client can't connect to anything and throws an error
this is a problem with how the networking is done and can only be fixed with a dedicated server.
If you want to help us get a dedicated cloud server you can donate to the devs!

Q: Why do I have to open a folder to get to EspiNet and then open EspiNet?

A: This is how all apps actually work, the reason you have to open the file is because
the EXE is kept there. You can actually create something called a "Shortcut" most apps
do this automatically when installing to make it easier and less clunky to open,
you can do this manually by right clicking on EspiNet.exe and clicking
"create shortcut" then you can place it on your desktop (Or anywhere) like any other app.
