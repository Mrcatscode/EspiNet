# EspiNet
EspiNet is a chatroom application made by one of SSC's students FOR SSC students!

EspiNet is a completely safe and secure application for use on the SSC network
EspiNet is updated often and reliably to ensure maximum performance and versatility!

EspiNet was originaly made entirely by one person! Because there's not enough
students here that know Python (Or even how to code at all) who can help.
If you know Python and want to help please try making a pull request to show
us your skills! (Make optimisations to the current outdated source code and we will
see if you have the skills needed for working on EspiNet)

# Donations
EspiNet is completely free for all users, this does mean that the staff and main dev are completely
unpaid by this project, this can lead to some.... 'Slacking' when it comes to updates or moderation.
If you want to help prevent this you can donate here: [Coming Soon!]
